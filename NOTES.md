# Project notes

## Focused parts

- Recreated the core layout of the design including:
  - Page title/subtitle
  - Tiers features
  - Tiers table
  - Tiers pricing information
  - Free trial buttons
- Recreated the styling of the design (typography, spacing and overall CSS look and feel).
- Ensured responsive behavior for mobile view.
- Prepared for future data fetching by keeping configurable values in a separate file instead of hardcoding them.

## Design deviations

- Minor differences in font sizes/weights and colors.
- Buttons serving placeholder actions.
- Check mark icon not exactly the same.
- Limited offer message moved into center for cleaner look due to section being on its own in this implementation.

## Improvements with more time

- Recreate design to perfectly match stylings (fonts, colors).
- Break Table component into more subcomponents, improving reusability.
- Focuse a bit more on source code quality features, e.g. readability.
